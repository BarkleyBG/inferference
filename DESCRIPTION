Description: Provides methods for estimating causal effects in the presence of interference described in  B. Saul and M. Hugdens  in "A Recipe for inferference: Start with Causal Inference. Add Interference. Mix Well with R" (Journal of Statistical Software, 82(2), 1-21). Currently it implements the inverse-probability weighted (IPW) estimators proposed by E.J. Tchetgen Tchetgen and T.J. Vanderweele in "On causal inference in the presence of interference" (Statistical Methods in Medical Research (2012), 21(1) 55-75).
