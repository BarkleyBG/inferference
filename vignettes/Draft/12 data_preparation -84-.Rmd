You need a data frame. Users need to be aware of any missing data. Missing data is handled by the estimation method. For example, `glmer` allows for missing values and will compute parameter estimates even with missing covariate values. `glm` will exclude records with missing values. `oracle` -- will it even work? Should I add a summary statement that tells the user show missing data was handled?
