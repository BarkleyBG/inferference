Do vaccines protect the treated as well as the untreated? Does retaining a child in a grade affect other students in the class? More generally, does the treatment of one subject affect the outcome of other subjects? In causal inference, this phenomena is known as interference. In this paper, we present `rinterference`, a R package that computes causal causal effect estimates when interference is known or presumed present. Examples from political sciences and infectious disease illustrate use of the package. Out-of-the-box tools offer a range of options, but researchers can also write their own functions to define the group-level propensity score.
